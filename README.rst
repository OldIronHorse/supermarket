supermarket
-----------

Implement a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items.

Some items have multiple prices base on price rules such as:

buy 3 (equal) items, pay for 2
buy 2 (equal) items for a special price
buy 3 (from a set of items) and the cheapest is free
for each N items of X, you get K items of Y free

spend X on items from set Y, get Z% off items in set Y

Output as a receipt with the actual price of every item and the grand total.
